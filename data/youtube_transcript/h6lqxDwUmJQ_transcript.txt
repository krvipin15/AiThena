DAVID MALAN: Hello, world. My name is David Malan, and this is
CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for
majors and non-majors alike. Indeed, whether you're among
those less comfortable or more comfortable with technology, this
course, and computer science more generally, are in fact for you. And it is free via platforms like
edX, YouTube, Apple TV, Google TV, and CS50's own website. Through this course, you'll learn
how to think more methodically, more algorithmically, so to speak. You'll learn how to
communicate succinctly and precisely, and you'll learn how to
solve problems efficiently with code. Indeed, this course begins
at the very beginning with a very friendly graphical
programming language called Scratch, via which you'll write code
by dragging and dropping puzzle pieces that
only interlock together if it makes logical sense to do so. We'll then transition to C, a more
traditional keyboard-based language, via which you'll learn how computers
work underneath the hood, so to speak. Thereafter, the course
moves on to Python, a more modern language via which you can
analyze data, automate processes, build web applications, and more, and SQL,
via which you can read and write lots and lots of data in databases. Toward course's end, we'll dive
into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, languages with which you can create
web apps and mobile apps alike. And at course's end, you'll design and
implement your very own final project for the world to see. You will have learned how to program. And if at any point
you get stuck, there's a whole CS50 community to support you,
as well as nowadays a virtual rubber duck of whom you can also ask
questions anytime, thanks to AI. All this and more, this is CS50.
